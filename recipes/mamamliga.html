    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup of corn flower</li>
      <li>1 tbs of salt</li>
      <li>4 cups of water</li>
      <li>2 tbs butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring water and salt to a boil in a large saucepan; pour polenta slowly
        into boiling water, whisking constantly until there are no lumps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to low and simmer, whisking often, until polenta starts to
        thicken, about 5 minutes. Polenta mixture should still be slightly
        loose. Cover and cook for 30 minutes, whisking every 5 to 6 minutes.
        When polenta is too thick to whisk, stir with a wooden spoon. Polenta is
        done when texture is creamy and the individual grains are tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off heat and gently stir 2 tablespoons butter into polenta until
        butter partially melts; mix 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese into
        polenta until cheese has melted. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes to
        thicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir polenta and transfer to a serving bowl. Top polenta with remaining
        1 tablespoon butter.
      </li>
    </ol>
