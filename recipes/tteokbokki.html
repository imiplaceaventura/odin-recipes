    <h3>This is everyone's favorite Korean street food!</h3>
    <p>
      It is made with rice cakes (garaetteok, cylinder-shaped rice cake), fish
      cakes, boiled egg, and seasoned with chile paste. The rice cakes are chewy
      and tender. It looks super spicy and, originally, it is! But you can
      control the amount of chile paste. You might be able to find it easily at
      food vendors on the street of Korea. There are always delicious dukbokki
      boiling and ready to go. Garnish with sesame seeds if you like.
